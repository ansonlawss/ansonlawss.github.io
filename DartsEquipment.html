    <p class="subtitle">Which equipment should you choose?</p>
    <p class="content">
        Darts bars have house darts ready for you to use, but the weight and balance of these darts
        differ from place to place.
        In order to stabilize your throw, we recommend that you get your own darts once you have gotten used to the
        game.
        Darts equipment come in a variety of types and shapes, so you should actually practice a few rounds with the
        items when choosing. Choose the items that suit you or by the design you like.
        Here we will provide a simple explanation of the different types available for each parts.
    </p>

    <p class="subtitle">Barrels</p>
    <p class="content">
        The part of the dart that you grip. It is the most important part that will be the center of
        balance on the dart. Be sure to take your time and choose one that suits you!
        The barrels mainly come in two materials, Brass and tungsten. For beginners we recommend the comparatively
        lighter brass types! For most players who are medium level or higher, we recommend the tungsten dart.

            <p class="content">
                Mainly made of brass, these barrels are lighter and less expensive.
                Since the barrel is thick, it is easy to grip for people with large hands and beginners.
                Many of these types of barrels have a center of gravity positioned towards the front, making it easy to
                throw in a nice parabolic line.
                Therefore brass darts are recommended for beginners.

                <p class="content">
                    These barrels are made of nickel and tungsten alloy. They are stronger, thinner, and
                    heavier than brass.
                    As you improve your darts skills, you will want to land multiple darts in a small area such as the
                    BULL in order to gain more points.
                    If the barrel is too thick, your dart will go out of the board. So it is better to choose the
                    thinner tungsten darts over brass darts.

        If the flight is large, there is more air resistance, and that makes it easier to throw the dart

        The longer the shaft is, the more stable the dart is, and you can throw the dart easily without

        The tip is the part that sticks in the dart board. It is made of plastic. Expendable.
        In order to reduce the weight, there are some designs with a hole. We recommend using different lengths and

                <p class="content">
                    Longer the tip, it is easier to hit the board. So, the longer tip is recommended for
                    beginners.
                    Using the long tip will make the distance from the barrel long,for this reason this type is also
                    recommended for advanced players aiming to hit the same target.

                <img class="center" src="../src/Tip_Short.jpg" alt="Tip of ShortSize">
                <p class="content">
                    Since it is lighter than long types, it does not significantly affect the overall
                    weight of the dart.
                    Additionally, since it has a higher resistance that the long type, it is stronger. If your tip is
                    easily broken, you should try this type.
