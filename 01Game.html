    <p class="content">
        The game starts with a set number of points.
        The first player who manages to reduce his score to exactly 0 wins!
        If a player’s points goes below zero, it is called BUST, and he must start again with the score he had at the
        previous round.
    </p>

    <p class="subtitle">3 throws in 1 round</p>

    <p class="content">
        Each player throws 3 times per round.
        This is repeated until a player reduces his score to exactly 0.
    </p>

    <p class="subtitle">Types of “01”</p>

    <p class="content">
        There are wide variety of “01” games such as 301, 501, 701, 901, 1101, and 1501! Since the last 2 digits are all
        “01”, this game is also called Zero One.

    <p class="subtitle">ONE POINT!</p>

    <p class="content">
        First aim for bull, then try to leave areas that will make it easier to reduce the score to exactly 0!
        At the beginning of the game, focus on reducing your score.
        It is okay to aim for a high score with a triple, but if you miss, it might land on a single, so as a basic
        rule, aim for bull.
        As you reach towards the end of the game, be aware of how you will reduce the score to 0 and leave the areas
        that would help you do that.
        We recommend leaving numbers that are easy to combine, such as 24, 32, 36, 40, 50, and 60!
    </p>

    <p class="subtitle">Secret of winning</p>

    <p class="content">
        Leaving 32 points is effective!
        If you leave 32 points, 8 and 16 are next to each other, so you can aim for a double at 16, and if you miss and
        get a single 16, single or double 8, it is easy to recover.
