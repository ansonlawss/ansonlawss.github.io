    <p class="subtitle">Rules</p>

    <p class="subtitle">The six numbers and bull are the target!</p>
    <p class="content">Only the areas of 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and bull are the target.
        Be careful because if you land anywhere else, you won’t get any points!</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Aim to open before your opponent!</p>

    <p class="content">If you hit any of the six numbers or bull, a mark is added to that number.
        Once there are three marks, the number is open, and after that, hitting that number will score the player
        points.
    </p>

    <p class="content"><img src="../src/Standard_Cricket_Single.jpg">: 1 mark (Single)</p>
    <p class="content"><img src="../src/Standard_Cricket_Double.jpg">: 2 marks (Double x 1)</p>
    <p class="content"><img src="../src/Standard_Cricket_Triple.jpg">: 3 marks (Triple x 1, or Double x 1 + Single x 1,
        or
        Single × 3)</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Act fast when your opponent opens a number!</p>

    <p class="content">
        If your opponent opens a number, opponent will be able to score on that number.
        In order to prevent your opponent from scoring points, you must close that number by getting three
        marks. If the number is closed, oppenent can no longer score points on that closed area.
        Before spending time closing numbers, form a strategy so that you can open numbers first!

    <p class="subtitle">ONE POINT!</p>

    <p class="subtitle">First securely hit singles!</p>

    <p class="content">To quickly close numbers, it is okay to aim for doubles and triples, but the basic strategy is to
        first securely hit three singles.
        Once you are used to the game, you can use doubles and triples to aim for higher scores!
        If your opponent has closed a number, you must determine whether you should work to close that
        number or work on getting more points depending on how the game is progressing.
        You must not only consider the point gap between you and your opponent and the number of numbers
        closed, but also the difference in skills and the numbers you are good at hitting and those you are
        not.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Secret to winning!</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Attack in a horizontal line!</p>

    <p class="content">The basic strategy is to aim to mark numbers with high points in order from 20 to 19, then 18,
        but
        since the position changes significantly as you count down it can be difficult to aim.
        So a good strategy is to work in a horizontal line. If the order is 20,18,19, and 17, you are just
        shifting your aim horizontally, so you can continue to aim for marks!
        16,19,17, and 15 are the lower horizontal line and easier to aim for, so another strategy might be
        to aim for this line first.
        However, if you focus only on the numbers to close, you tend to forget the number of rounds, so be
        aware of the designated number of rounds and play accordingly!
        STANDARD CRICKET is a deep and interesting game.
        You cannot win with a set pattern, so change your strategy depending on your opponent and aim to
        win!
